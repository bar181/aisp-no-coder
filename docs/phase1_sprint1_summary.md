# Phase 1: Sprint 1 Summary

Sprint 1 of the AISP PoC Creator focused on building a minimal, working proof-of-concept that demonstrates the core idea: transforming a simple YAML idea sheet into live CRUD API endpoints.

## Key Outcomes

-   **YAML to Spec Generation**: A Python script (`generator/gen.py`) was developed to read a YAML idea sheet (`examples/vehicle.yml`), process defined features (specifically "CRUD" operations for entities), and generate JSON component specifications.
-   **Spec Validation**: Generated specifications are validated against a defined JSON schema (`schema/aisp_component.schema.json`) to ensure correctness and consistency.
-   **Dynamic API Routing**: A FastAPI application (`app/main.py`) with a dynamic router (`app/dynamic_router.py`) was implemented. This router reads the generated component specifications from Supabase at startup and dynamically creates API endpoints based on the specs.
-   **Stubbed Agent**: A generic agent stub (`app/agent.py`) was included to handle requests to the dynamically generated endpoints. In Sprint 1, this agent simply echoes the received payload.
-   **Supabase Integration**: Generated specs are stored in a Supabase database, which the dynamic router queries.
-   **Basic Tooling**: Scripts for seeding sample data (`scripts/seed.py`) and basic health check tests (`tests/test_health.py`) were included.
-   **CI Workflow**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) was set up to automate testing of the generator and the health check.

## Documentation Created

The following documentation files have been created to detail Sprint 1:

-   [Project Overview](docs/1_project_overview.md)
-   [Installation and Setup](docs/2_installation_setup.md)
-   [Sprint 1 Technical Details](docs/3_sprint1_technical_details.md)
-   [API Reference (Sprint 1)](docs/5_api_reference_sprint1.md)

## Next Steps

Sprint 1 provides a foundational baseline. Future sprints will build upon this by implementing the actual logic within the agent, expanding the schema and template to support more complex entities and features, and adding full CRUD functionality to the dynamically generated endpoints.
